## FAQ

#### How is the Companion Core different from projects like Jibo, Alexa, and Siri?

The Companion Core is an effort to create a generalized AI. This is achieved by combining software written for a generalized purpose, like an adaptive facial recognition program or a generalized object detection software. Paired with projects like the Perpetual Programming Initiative, the effort to create a self-evolving software is not too far out of reach
